# Chemcraft is a visualization and structure preparation software

Chemcraft is one of the suggestion visualization software for Orca. However, other software can still be used provided that they produce the same structure representation compatible with Orca calculations (e.g. xyz files, etc.)


For this part we will create a water molecule and prepare an input file an Orca calculation.

Open up your Chemcraft and start creating a water molecule (DEMO)

# Prepare for a simple water calculation

In your own directory, create a `water` folder.

```
cd ~/yourname
mkdir water
cd water
```

Inside the water directory, create the input file `water.inp` using vim.

```
vim water.inp
```

Copy the snippet below and paste into the file:

```
%pal nprocs 4 end
%MaxCore 2000
! 6-31G** Opt Freq xyzfile

* xyz 0 1
[insert the coordinate block here]
*
```
