# 01 ‚Äì Basic Terminal Navigation

Before running any jobs on the cluster, you'll need to know how to **move around the file system**, see where you are, and list files and directories.

## üìç Where Am I?

To check your current location in the file system, use:

`pwd`

Output example:

`/home/training`

This tells you your present working directory.

## Listing Files

To see what‚Äôs in your current directory:

`ls`

Ass options for more detail:

```
ls -l     # Long format with permissions and sizes
ls -a     # Include hidden files
ls -lh    # Human-readable sizes
```

## Changing Directories

Move into a directory with:

`cd foldername`

Go up one level with:

`cd ..`

Return to your home **directory**:

`cd ~`

Go to a specific path:

`cd /shared/scratch/orca`
