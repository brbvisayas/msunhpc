# 01 – Basic Terminal Navigation

Before running any jobs on the cluster, you'll need to know how to **move around the file system**, see where you are, and list files and directories.

---

## Where Am I?

To check your current location in the file system, use:

`pwd`

Output example:

`/home/guest`

This tells you your present working directory.

## Listing Files

To see what’s in your current directory:

`ls`

Ass options for more detail:

```
ls -l     # Long format with permissions and sizes
ls -a     # Include hidden files
ls -lh    # Human-readable sizes
```

## Making a directory

Let's make the directory where you will be working on.

```
cd ~
mkdir [your_name]   # don't use spaces, e.g., mkdir johndoe
```

## Changing Directories

Move into a directory with:

`cd yourname`

Go up one level with:

`cd ..`

Return to your home **directory**:

`cd ~`

Go to a specific path:

`cd /shared/scratch/orca`

## Notes
**Absolute Paths**
```
/home/guest
/shared/scratch/orca
```

**Relative Paths**
```
.   # Current directory
..  # Directory above current directory
~   # Your home directory
-   # Previous directory
```
