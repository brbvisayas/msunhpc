# Running ORCA on the Cluster

Once you've prepared an ORCA input file, the next step is to **run the calculation**. There are multiple ways to do this on the MSU HPC cluster, depending on your workflow.

In this guide, weâ€™ll cover:

- Running ORCA directly from the terminal (basic)
- Running ORCA with a Slurm script (recommended generally)
- Running ORCA using the `sorca`->`runorca` wrapper (automated workflow; **RECOMMENDED**)

## 1. Running ORCA Directly (Simple Test)

You can run a small ORCA job interactively (not recommended for real jobs):

Go to your water directory and make sure you have `water.inp`

MSUNHPC uses modules for its software. In order to use the proper version and build of `orca` we need to load that module.

To check the available modules:

`module avail`

To load the orca:

`module load orca`

To see which modules are currently loaded on your session:

`module list`

See that you have loaded the proper orca:
`which orca`

should output

`/shared/apps/orca/6.0.1_ompi_4.1.6/orca`

If you had not loaded the module it would have outputed:

`/usr/bin/orca` which is the wrong version.

Running an orca calculation:

```
`which orca` water.inp > water.out
```
You will not be able to interact with the terminal until the process completes (unless you added an ampersand `&` at the end of the command to put the process in the background). Nevertheless, this method is highly discouraged (except for very simple and quick check runs) as this utilizes the resources of the `headnode` which is very minimal compared to the resources available in the compute nodes

Explore the results after the calculation completes.
