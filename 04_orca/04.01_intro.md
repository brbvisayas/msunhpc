# 00 – Introduction to ORCA and Quantum Chemistry

In this module, we introduce the **ORCA** software package and provide essential background on **quantum chemistry methods**, with a focus on **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** — the workhorse of many modern molecular simulations.

This sets the stage for the practical ORCA workflows that follow.

## What Is Quantum Chemistry?

Quantum chemistry is the application of quantum mechanics to chemical systems. Instead of using classical models like Lewis structures or force fields, quantum chemistry calculates properties based on the **electronic structure** of molecules using **wavefunctions** or **electron densities**.

Key applications include:
- Geometry optimization
- Energy calculations
- Reaction mechanisms
- Spectroscopy
- Adsorption and surface chemistry

## What Is DFT?

**Density Functional Theory (DFT)** is a widely used approach in quantum chemistry that focuses on the **electron density** rather than the full wavefunction. It balances accuracy and computational cost, making it suitable for medium- to large-sized systems.

- DFT is ideal for studying ground-state properties of molecules
- It uses **functionals** to approximate the complex interactions between electrons
- Common functionals: B3LYP, PBE, ωB97X-D

## What Is ORCA?

[**ORCA**](https://www.faccts.de/docs/orca/6.0/manual/index.html) is a powerful, freely available quantum chemistry program developed by Frank Neese’s group at the Max Planck Institute. It is capable of performing a wide range of calculations using methods such as:

- Hartree-Fock (HF)
- DFT
- MP2, CCSD(T), and other post-HF methods
- TD-DFT (for excited states)
- Spectroscopic simulations (IR, NMR, EPR, UV-vis)

ORCA is particularly well-suited for:
- Transition metal complexes
- Spectroscopy
- Biomolecules
- HPC environments (parallel support via OpenMPI)

## Features of ORCA

- Easy-to-read input format
- Highly customizable job types
- Works well on personal computers and HPC clusters
- Efficient parallel scaling for many job types
- Active support via the ORCA user forum

## Requirements to Run ORCA

To run ORCA on this HPC cluster:

- ORCA must be installed and accessible via environment variables or modules
- ORCA input files must be prepared using a text editor (see earlier module)
- Jobs must be submitted through the **Slurm** scheduler using appropriate CPU/GPU allocations
