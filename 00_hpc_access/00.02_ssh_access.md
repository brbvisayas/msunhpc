# 02 – SSH Access

To use the MSU HPC cluster, you'll need to connect remotely from your computer using **SSH (Secure Shell)** — a protocol that allows you to securely access remote systems via the command line.

## Access Method

Due to network restrictions on campus, the cluster is accessed through a **reverse SSH tunnel** to a Google Cloud VPS that serves as a relay.

Use the following command to connect:

`ssh -p 2222 training@35.221.236.185`
