| C=O stretch | | | | Electronic redistribution |
| Amide I | | | | Peptide perturbation |

Values are extracted from Chemcraft.

Students should:
- Animate selected modes in Chemcraft
- Capture screenshots
- Describe atomic motions in words

Example description:
> The O–H stretching mode shifts to lower frequency and becomes more delocalized upon complexation, consistent with hydrogen-bond formation.

Students should comment on:
- Orbital localization
- Any ligand–peptide mixing
- Whether interaction is primarily electrostatic or orbital-driven

### 6.6 Complexation Energy

**Definition**

\[
\Delta E_{\text{complex}} =
E_{\text{SA–Dipeptide}} -
\left(E_{\text{SA}} + E_{\text{Dipeptide}}\right)
\]

- Energies taken from **PBE0-D3BJ optimized outputs**
- Convert Hartree to kcal/mol using:
  \[
  1\ \text{Hartree} = 627.509\ \text{kcal/mol}
  \]

**Table 2. Complexation energy**

| System | Energy (Hartree) |
|------|------------------|
| SA | |
| Dipeptide | |
| SA–Dipeptide | |
| ΔEcomplex (kcal/mol) | |

Notes:
- Gas-phase interaction energy
- No entropy or solvent correction
- Used for qualitative comparison only
